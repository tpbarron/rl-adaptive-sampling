RL Adaptive Sampling

TODO:
X * Check that kalman error is not going to zero immediately
X * Full covariance approximation
* Explore ways to improve stability
* Benchmark on common functions
* Benchmark on continuous CartPole
    * Cartpole with many different hyperparams
    * Perhaps same for walker 2d. then pick best for remaining tasks
* Benchmark diff between Adam / LBFGS
